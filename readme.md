A Ruby implementation of [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/).

 - [Website](https://rmosolgo.github.io/graphql-ruby)
 - [API Documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby)

## Installation

Install from RubyGems by adding it to your `Gemfile`, then bundling.

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'graphql'
```

```
$ bundle install
```

## Getting Started

See "Getting Started" on the [website](https://rmosolgo.github.io/graphql-ruby/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby/blob/master/guides/index.md)

## Goals

- Implement the GraphQL spec & support a Relay front end
- Provide idiomatic, plain-Ruby API with similarities to reference implementation where possible
- Support Ruby on Rails and Relay

## Getting Involved

- __Say hi & ask questions__ in the [#ruby channel on Slack](https://ruby.slack.com/) or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rmosolgo)!
- __Report bugs__ by posting a description, full stack trace, and all relevant code in a  [GitHub issue](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby/issues).
- __Features & patches__ are welcome! Consider discussing it in an [issue](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby/issues) or in the [#ruby channel on Slack](https://ruby.slack.com/) to make sure we're on the same page.
- __Run the tests__ with `rake test` or start up guard with `bundle exec guard`.
- __Build the site__ with `rake site:serve`, then visit `http://localhost:4000/graphql-ruby/`.

## To Do

- StaticValidation improvements ([in progress](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby/pull/268))
  - Use catch-all type/field/argument definitions instead of terminating traversal
  - Reduce ad-hoc traversals?
  - Validators are order-dependent, is this a smell?
  - Tests for interference between validators are poor
  - Maybe this is a candidate for a rewrite?
- Relay:
  - Reduce duplication in ArrayConnection / RelationConnection
  - Improve API for creating edges (better RANGE_ADD support)
  - If the new edge isn't a member of the connection's objects, raise a nice error
- `args` should whitelist keys -- if you request a key that isn't defined for the field, it should ðŸ’¥
- Support non-instance-eval `.define`, eg `.define { |defn| ... }`
- First-class promise support ([discussion](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby/issues/274))
  - like `graphql-batch` but more local
  - support promises in connection resolves
- Add immutable transformation API to AST
  - Support working with AST as data
  - Adding fields to selections (`__typename` can go anywhere, others are type-specific)
  - Renaming fragments from local names to unique names
- Document encrypted & versioned cursors
