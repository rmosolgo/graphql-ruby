  class Subscriptions
    # A subscriptions implementation that sends data
    # as ActionCable broadcastings.
    #
    # Experimental, some things to keep in mind:
    #
    # - No queueing system; ActiveJob should be added
    # - Take care to reload context when re-delivering the subscription. (see {Query#subscription_update?})
    #
    # @example Adding ActionCableSubscriptions to your schema
    #   MySchema = GraphQL::Schema.define do
    #     # ...
    #     use GraphQL::Subscriptions::ActionCableSubscriptions
    #   end
    #
    # @example Implementing a channel for GraphQL Subscriptions
    #   class GraphqlChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
    #     def subscribed
    #       @subscription_ids = []
    #     end

    #         current_user: current_user,
    #         # Make sure the channel is in the context
    #         channel: self,
    #       }
