      # This function implements the instrumentation policy:
      #
      # - Instrumenters are a stack; the first `before_query` will have the last `after_query`
      # - If a `before_` hook returned without an error, its corresponding `after_` hook will run.
      # - If the `before_` hook did _not_ run, the `after_` hook will not be called.
      #
      # When errors are raised from `after_` hooks:
      #   - Subsequent `after_` hooks _are_ called
      #   - The first raised error is captured; later errors are ignored
      #   - If an error was capture, it's re-raised after all hooks are finished
      #
      # Partial runs of instrumentation are possible:
      # - If a `before_multiplex` hook raises an error, no `before_query` hooks will run
      # - If a `before_query` hook raises an error, subsequent `before_query` hooks will not run (on any query)
