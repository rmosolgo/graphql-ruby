module GraphQL
  # {Field}s belong to {ObjectType}s and {InterfaceType}s.
  #
  # They're usually created with the `field` helper. If you create it by hand, make sure {#name} is a String.
  #
  # A field must have a return type, but if you want to defer the return type calculation until later,
  # you can pass a proc for the return type. That proc will be called when the schema is defined.
  #
  # @example Lazy type resolution
  #   # If the field's type isn't defined yet, you can pass a proc
  #   field :city, -> { TypeForModelName.find("City") }
  #
  # For complex field definition, you can pass a block to the `field` helper, eg `field :name do ... end`.
  # This block is equivalent to calling `GraphQL::Field.define { ... }`.
  #
  # @example Defining a field with a block
  #   field :city, CityType do
  #     # field definition continues inside the block
  #   end
  #
  # ## Resolve
  #
  # Fields have `resolve` functions to determine their values at query-time.
  # The default implementation is to call a method on the object based on the field name.
  #
  # @example Create a field which calls a method with the same name.
  #   GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
  #     field :name, types.String, "The name of this thing "
  #   end
  #
  # You can specify a custom proc with the `resolve` helper.
  #
  # There are some shortcuts for common `resolve` implementations:
  #   - Provide `property:` to call a method with a different name than the field name
  #   - Provide `hash_key:` to resolve the field by doing a key lookup, eg `obj[:my_hash_key]`
  #
  # @example Create a field that calls a different method on the object
  #   GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
  #     # use the `property` keyword:
  #     field :firstName, types.String, property: :first_name
  #   end
  #
  # @example Create a field looks up with `[hash_key]`
  #   GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
  #     # use the `hash_key` keyword:
  #     field :firstName, types.String, hash_key: :first_name
  #   end
  #
  # ## Arguments
  #
  # Fields can take inputs; they're called arguments. You can define them with the `argument` helper.
  #
  # @example Create a field with an argument
  #   field :students, types[StudentType] do
  #     argument :grade, types.Int
  #     resolve ->(obj, args, ctx) {
  #       Student.where(grade: args[:grade])
  #     }
  #   end
  #
  # They can have default values which will be provided to `resolve` if the query doesn't include a value.
  #
  # @example Argument with a default value
  #   field :events, types[EventType] do
  #     # by default, don't include past events
  #     argument :includePast, types.Boolean, default_value: false
  #     resolve ->(obj, args, ctx) {
  #       args[:includePast] # => false if no value was provided in the query
  #       # ...
  #     }
  #   end
  #
  # Only certain types maybe used for inputs:
  #
  # - Scalars
  # - Enums
  # - Input Objects
  # - Lists of those types
  #
  # Input types may also be non-null -- in that case, the query will fail
  # if the input is not present.
  #
  # ## Complexity
  #
  # Fields can have _complexity_ values which describe the computation cost of resolving the field.
  # You can provide the complexity as a constant with `complexity:` or as a proc, with the `complexity` helper.
  #
  # @example Custom complexity values
  #   # Complexity can be a number or a proc.
  #
  #   # Complexity can be defined with a keyword:
  #   field :expensive_calculation, !types.Int, complexity: 10
  #
  #   # Or inside the block:
  #   field :expensive_calculation_2, !types.Int do
  #     complexity ->(ctx, args, child_complexity) { ctx[:current_user].staff? ? 0 : 10 }
  #   end
  #
  # @example Calculating the complexity of a list field
  #   field :items, types[ItemType] do
  #     argument :limit, !types.Int
  #     # Mulitply the child complexity by the possible items on the list
  #     complexity ->(ctx, args, child_complexity) { child_complexity * args[:limit] }
  #   end
  #
  # @example Creating a field, then assigning it to a type
  #   name_field = GraphQL::Field.define do
  #     name("Name")
  #     type(!types.String)
  #     description("The name of this thing")
  #     resolve ->(object, arguments, context) { object.name }
  #   end
  #
  #   NamedType = GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
  #     # The second argument may be a GraphQL::Field
  #     field :name, name_field
  #   end
  #
