### New Features

- Add `:datadog` monitoring

## 1.4.0 (19 Apr 2017)

### New Features

- `ActiveRecord::Relation`s can be scoped by Pundit `Scope`s, CanCan `accessible_by`, or custom strategy's `#scope(gate, relation)` methods
- Default authorization configuration can be provided with `authorization(..., fallback: { ... })`

## 1.3.0 (7 Mar 2017)

### New Features

- Serve static, persisted queries with `GraphQL::Pro::Repository`

## 1.2.3 (2 May 2017)

### Bug Fix

- Fix compatibility of `RelationConnection` and `RangeAdd` helper

## 1.2.2 (6 Mar 2017)

### Bug Fix

- Raise `GraphQL::Pro::RelationConnection::InvalidRelationError` when a grouped, unordered relation is returned from a field. (This relation can't be stably paginated.)

## 1.2.1 (3 Mar 2017)

### New Features

- Formally support ActiveRecord `>= 4.1.0`

### Bug Fix

- Support grouped relations in `GraphQL::Pro::RelationConnection`

## 1.2.0 (1 Mar 2017)

### New Features

- Authorize fields based on their parent object, for example:

  ```ruby
  AccountType = GraphQL::ObjectType.define do
    name "Account"
    # This field is visible to all users:
    field :name, types.String
    # This is only visible when the current user is an `:owner`
    # of this account
    field :account_balance, types.Int, authorize: { parent_role: :owner }
  end
  ```

## 1.1.1 (22 Feb 2017)

### Bug Fixes

- Fix monitoring when `Query#selected_operation` is nil

## 1.1.0 (9 Feb 2017)

### New Features

- Add AppSignal monitoring platform
- Add type- and field-level opting in and opting out of monitoring
- Add `monitor_scalars: false` to skip monitoring on scalars

### Bug Fixes

- Fix `OrderedRelationConnection` when neither `first` nor `last` are provided (use `max_page_size` or don't limit)

## 1.0.4 (23 Jan 2017)

### Bug Fixes

- `OrderedRelationConnection` exposes more metadata methods: `parent`, `field`, `arguments`, `max_page_size`, `first`, `after`, `last`, `before`

## 1.0.3 (23 Jan 2017)

### Bug Fixes

- When an authorization check fails on a non-null field, propagate the null and add a response to the errors key (as if the field had returned null). It previously leaked the internal symbol `__graphql_pro_access_not_allowed__`.
- Apply a custom Pundit policy even when the value isn't `nil`. (It previously fell back to `Pundit.policy`, skipping a `pundit_policy_name` configuration.)

## 1.0.2

### Bug Fixes

- `OrderedRelationConnection` exposes the underlying relation as `#nodes` (like `RelationConnection` does), supporting custom connection fields.

## 1.0.1

### New Features

- CanCan integration now supports a custom `Ability` class with the `ability_class:` option:

  ```ruby
  authorize :cancan, ability_class: CustomAbility
  ```

## 1.0.0

- `GraphQL::Pro` released
