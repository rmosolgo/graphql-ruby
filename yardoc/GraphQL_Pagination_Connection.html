    <p>Class: GraphQL::Pagination::Connection &lt; Object
A Connection wraps a list of items and provides cursor-based
pagination over it. 
Connections were introduced by Facebook’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">Relay</code> front-end
framework, but proved to be generally useful for GraphQL APIs. When
in doubt, use connections to serve lists (like Arrays,
ActiveRecord::Relations) via GraphQL. 
Unlike the previous connection implementation, these default to
bidirectional pagination. 
Pagination arguments and context may be provided at initialization
or assigned later (see Schema::Field::ConnectionExtension).
