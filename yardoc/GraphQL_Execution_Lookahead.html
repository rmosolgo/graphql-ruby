    <p>Class: GraphQL::Execution::Lookahead &lt; Object
Lookahead creates a uniform interface to inspect the forthcoming
selections. 
It assumes that the AST it’s working with is valid. (So, it’s safe
to use during execution, but if you’re using it directly, be sure to
validate first.) 
A field may get access to its lookahead by adding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extras:
[:lookahead]</code> to its configuration. 
Examples:</p>
<h1 id="looking-ahead-in-a-field">looking ahead in a field</h1>
<p>field :articles, [Types::Article], null: false,
extras: [:lookahead]</p>
<h1 id="for-example-imagine-a-faster-database-call">For example, imagine a faster database call</h1>
<h1 id="may-be-issued-when-only-some-fields-are-requested">may be issued when only some fields are requested.</h1>
<p>#</p>
<h1 id="imagine-that-full-fetch-must-be-made-to-satisfy-fullcontent">Imagine that <em>full</em> fetch must be made to satisfy <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fullContent</code>,</h1>
<h1 id="we-can-look-ahead-to-see-if-we-need-that-field-if-we-do">we can look ahead to see if we need that field. If we do,</h1>
<h1 id="we-make-the-expensive-database-call-instead-of-the-cheap-one">we make the expensive database call instead of the cheap one.</h1>
<p>def articles(lookahead:)
if lookahead.selects?(:full_content)
fetch_full_articles(object)
else
fetch_preview_articles(object)
end
end
