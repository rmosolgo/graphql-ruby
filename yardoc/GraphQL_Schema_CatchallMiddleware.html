    <p>Module: GraphQL::Schema::CatchallMiddleware
In early GraphQL versions, errors would be “automatically” rescued
and replaced with <code class="highlighter-rouge">"Internal error"</code>. That behavior was undesirable
but this middleware is offered for people who want to preserve it. 
It has a couple of differences from the previous behavior:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Other parts of the query <em>will</em> be run (previously,
execution would stop when the error was raised and the result
would have no <code class="highlighter-rouge">"data"</code> key at all)</li>
  <li>The entry in Query::Context#errors is a GraphQL::ExecutionError,
<em>not</em>
the originally-raised error.</li>
  <li>The entry in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">"errors"</code> key includes the location of the field
which raised the errors.
Examples:
    <h1 id="use-catchallmiddleware-with-your-schema">Use CatchallMiddleware with your schema</h1>
    <h1 id="all-errors-will-be-suppressed-and-replaced-with-internal-error-messages">All errors will be suppressed and replaced with “Internal error” messages</h1>
