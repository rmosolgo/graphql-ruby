    <p>Module: GraphQL::Tracing::CallLegacyTracers
This trace class calls legacy-style tracer with payload hashes.
New-style <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trace_with</code> modules significantly reduce the overhead of
tracing, but that advantage is lost when legacy-style tracers are
also used (since the payload hashes are still constructed). 
Instance methods:
analyze_multiplex, analyze_query, authorized, authorized_lazy,
execute_field, execute_field_lazy, execute_multiplex, execute_query,
execute_query_lazy, lex, parse, resolve_type, resolve_type_lazy,
validate</p>
