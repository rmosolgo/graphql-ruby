    <p>Class: GraphQL::Execution::Lazy &lt; Object
This class is part of a private API.
This wraps a value which is available, but not yet calculated, like
a promise or future. 
Calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">#value</code> will trigger calculation &amp; return the “lazy” value.
This is an itty-bitty promise-like object, with key differences: -
It has only two states, not-resolved and resolved - It has no
error-catching functionality 
Class methods:
all, resolve
Instance methods:
initialize, then, value</p>
