    <p>Module: GraphQL::Types::Relay
This module contains some types and fields that could support Relay
conventions in GraphQL. 
You can use these classes out of the box if you want, but if you
want to use your <em>own</em> GraphQL extensions along with the features in
this code, you could also open up the source files and copy the
relevant methods and configuration into your own classes. 
For example, the provided object types extend
Types::Relay::BaseObject, but you might want to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Migrate the extensions from Types::Relay::BaseObject into <em>your
app’s</em> base object 2. Copy Relay::BaseConnection, Relay::BaseEdge,
etc into <em>your app</em>, and
change them to extend <em>your</em> base object.
Similarly, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BaseField</code>’s extensions could be migrated to your app
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Node</code> could be implemented to mix in your base interface
module. 
Defined Under Namespace:
ClassMethods, ConnectionBehaviors, EdgeBehaviors, HasNodeField,
HasNodesField, Node, NodeBehaviors, PageInfoBehaviors (modules)
BaseConnection, BaseEdge, PageInfo (classes)</li>
</ol>
