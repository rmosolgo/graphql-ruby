    <p>Module: GraphQL::Compatibility::ExecutionSpecification
Test an execution strategy. This spec is not meant as a development
aid. Rather, when the strategy <em>works</em>, run it here to see if it has
any differences from the built-in strategy.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Custom scalar input / output - Null propagation - Query-level
masking - Directive support - Typecasting - Error handling (raise /
return GraphQL::ExecutionError) - Provides Irep &amp; AST node to
resolve fn - Skipping fields 
Some things are explicitly <em>not</em> tested here, because they’re
handled by other parts of the system:</li>
  <li>Schema definition (including types and fields) - Parsing &amp; parse
errors - AST -&gt; IRep transformation (eg, fragment merging) - Query
validation and analysis - Relay features 
Defined Under Namespace:
CounterSchema, SpecificationSchema (modules)
Class methods:
build_suite</li>
</ul>
