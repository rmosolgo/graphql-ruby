    <p>Class: GraphQL::Tracing::Trace &lt; Object
This is the base class for a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trace</code> instance whose methods are
called during query execution. “Trace modes” are subclasses of this
with custom tracing modules mixed in. 
A trace module may implement any of the methods on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trace</code>, being
sure to call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">super</code> to continue any tracing hooks and call the
actual runtime behavior. See GraphQL::Backtrace::Trace for example.
