    <p>Class: GraphQL::Execution::Multiplex &lt; Object
This class is part of a private API.
Execute multiple queries under the same multiplex “umbrella”. They
can share a batching context and reduce redundant database hits. 
The flow is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiplex instrumentation setup - Query instrumentation setup -
Analyze the multiplex + each query - Begin each query - Resolve lazy
values, breadth-first across all queries - Finish each query (eg,
get errors) - Query instrumentation teardown - Multiplex
instrumentation teardown 
If one query raises an application error, all queries will be in
undefined states. 
Validation errors and {GraphQL::ExecutionError}s are handled in
isolation: one of these errors in one query will not affect the
other queries.
