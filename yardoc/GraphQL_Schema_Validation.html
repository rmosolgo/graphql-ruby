    <p>Class: GraphQL::Schema::Validation &lt; Object
This module provides a function for validating GraphQL types. 
Its RULES contain objects that respond to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#call(type)</code>. Rules are
looked up for given types (by class ancestry), then applied to the
object until an error is returned. 
Remove this in GraphQL-Ruby 2.0 when schema instances are removed. 
Class methods:
validate</p>
