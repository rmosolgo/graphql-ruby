    <p>Class: GraphQL::Schema::Directive::Feature &lt; GraphQL::Schema::Directive
An example directive to show how you might interact with the
runtime. 
This directive might be used along with a server-side feature flag
system like Flipper. 
With that system, you could use this directive to exclude parts of a
query if the current viewer doesn’t have certain flags enabled. (So,
this flag would be for internal clients, like your iOS app, not
third-party API clients.) 
To use it, you have to implement <code class="highlighter-rouge">.enabled?</code>, for example:
