    <p>Class: GraphQL::Schema::FieldExtension &lt; Object
Extend this class to make field-level customizations to resolve
behavior. 
When a extension is added to a field with <code class="highlighter-rouge">extension(MyExtension)</code>,
a <code class="highlighter-rouge">MyExtension</code> instance is created, and its hooks are applied
whenever that field is called. 
The instance is frozen so that instance variables aren’t modified
during query execution, which could cause all kinds of issues due to
race conditions. 
Direct Known Subclasses:
GraphQL::Schema::Field::ConnectionExtension,
GraphQL::Schema::Field::ScopeExtension,
GraphQL::Subscriptions::SubscriptionRoot::Extension
Instance methods:
after_resolve, apply, initialize, resolve</p>
