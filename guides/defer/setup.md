Before using `@defer` in queries, you have to:

- Update `graphql` and `graphql-pro` gems
- Add `@defer` to your GraphQL schema
- Update your HTTP handlers (eg, Rails controllers) to send streaming responses

You can also see a [full Rails & Apollo-Client demo](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql_defer_example).

## Updating the gems

`GraphQL::Pro::Defer` is included in `graphql-pro 1.10+`, and it requires the new {% internal_link "Interpreter runtime", "/queries/interpreter" %} in `graphql 1.9+`, so update your gemfile:

```ruby
# 1.9+ for Interpreter
gem "graphql", "~>1.9.0"
# 1.10+ for `@defer`
gem "graphql-pro", "~>1.10.0"
```

And then install them:

```
$ bundle update graphql graphql-pro
```

## Adding `@defer` to your schema

Then, add `GraphQL::Pro::Defer` to your schema as a plugin:

```ruby
class MySchema < GraphQL::Schema
  use GraphQL::Pro::Defer
end
```

This will:

- Attach a {% internal_link "custom directive", "/type_definitions/directives" %} called `@defer`
- Add instrumentation to queries to track deferred work and execute it later

## Sending streaming responses

Many web frameworks have support for streaming responses, for example:

- Rails has [ActionController::Live](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Live.html)
- Sinatra has [Sinatra::Streaming](http://sinatrarb.com/contrib/streaming.html)
- Hanami::Controller can [stream responses](https://github.com/hanami/controller#streamed-responses)

See below for how to integrate GraphQL's deferred patches with a streaming response API.

To investigate support with a web framework, please {% open_an_issue "Server support for @defer with ..." %} or email `support@graphql.pro`.

### Checking for deferrals

When a query has any `@defer`ed fields, you can check for `context[:defer]`:

```ruby
if context[:defer]
  # some fields were `@defer`ed
else
  # normal GraphQL, no `@defer`
end
```

### Working with deferrals

To handle deferrals, you can enumerate over `context[:defer]`, for example:

```ruby
context[:defer].each do |deferral|
  # do something with the `deferral`, eg
  # stream_to_client(deferral.to_h)
end
```

The initial result is _also_ present in the deferrals, so you can treat it just like a patch.

Each deferred patch has a few methods for building a response:

- `.to_h` returns a hash with `path:`, `data:`, and/or `errors:`. (There is no `path:` for the root result.)
- `.to_http_multipart` returns a string which works with Apollo client's `@defer` support.
- `.path` returns the path to this patch in the response
- `.data` returns successfully-resolved results of the patch
- `.errors` returns an array of errors, if there were any

Calling `.data` or `.errors` on a deferral will resume GraphQL execution until the patch is complete.

### Example: Rails with Apollo Client

In this example, a Rails controller will stream HTTP Multipart patches to the client, in Apollo Client's supported format.

```ruby
class GraphqlController < ApplicationController
  # Support `response.stream` below:
  include ActionController::Live

  def execute
    # ...
    result = MySchema.execute(query, variables: variables, context: context, operation_name: operation_name)

    # Check if this is a deferred query:
    if (deferred = result.context[:defer])
      # Use built-in `stream_http_multipart` with Apollo-Client & ActionController::Live
      deferred.stream_http_multipart(response)
    else
      # Return a plain, non-deferred result
      render json: result
    end
  ensure
    # Always make sure to close the stream
    response.stream.close
  end
end
```
