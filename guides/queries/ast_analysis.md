GraphQL-Ruby 1.9.0 includes a new way to do Ahead-of-Time analysis for your queries. Eventually, it will become the
default.

The new analysis runs on query ASTs instead of the GraphQL Ruby internal representation, which means some of the things you used to get for free need to be done in analyzers instead.

The new primitive for analysis is {{ "GraphQL::Analysis::AST::Analyzer" | api_doc }}. New analyzers must inherit from this base class and implement the desired methods for analysis.

## Analyzer API

Analyzers respond to methods similar to AST visitors:

```ruby
class BasicCounterAnalyzer < GraphQL::Analysis::AST::Analyzer
  def initialize(query_or_multiplex)
    super
    @fields = Set.new
    @arguments = Set.new
  end

  # Visitor are all defined on the AST::Analyzer base class
  # We override them for custom analyzers.
  def on_leave_field(node, _parent, _visitor)
    @fields.add(node.name)
  end

  def on_leave_argument(node, _parent, _visitor)
    @arguments.add(node.name)
  end

  def result
    [@fields, @arguments]
  end
end
```

In this example, we counted every field and argument, no matter if they were on fragment definitions
or if they were skipped by directives. In the old API, this used to be handled automatically because
the internal representation of the query took care of these concerns. With the new API, we can use helper
methods to help us achieve this:

```ruby
class BasicFieldAnalyzer < GraphQL::Analysis::AST::Analyzer
  def initialize(query_or_multiplex)
    super
    @fields = Set.new
  end

  # Visitor are all defined on the AST::Analyzer base class
  # We override them for custom analyzers.
  def on_leave_field(node, _parent, visitor)
    if visitor.skipping? || visitor.visiting_fragment_definition?
      # We don't want to count skipped fields or fields
      # inside fragment definitions
    else
      @fields.add(node.name)
    end
  end

  # We want to visit fragment spreads as soon as we hit them
  # instead of visiting the definitions. The visitor provides helper
  # methods to achieve that.
  def on_enter_fragment_spread(node, parent, visitor)
    visitor.enter_fragment_spread_inline(node)
  end

  def on_leave_fragment_definition(node, parent, visitor)
    visitor.leave_fragment_spread_inline(node)
  end

  def result
    @fields
  end
end
```

### Errors

It is still possible to return errors from an analyzer. To reject a query and halt its execution, you may return {{ "GraphQL::AnalysisError" | api_doc }} in the `result` method:

```ruby
class NoFieldsCalledHello < GraphQL::Analysis::AST::Analyzer
  def on_leave_field(node, _parent, visitor)
    if node.name == "hello"
      @field_called_hello = true
    end
  end

  def result
    GraphQL::AnalysisError.new("A field called `hello` was found.") if @field_called_hello
  end
end
```

### Conditional Analysis

Some analyzers might only make sense in certain context, or some might be too expensive to run for every query. To handle these scenarios, your analyzers may answer to an `analyze?` method:

```ruby
class BasicFieldAnalyzer < GraphQL::Analysis::AST::Analyzer
  # Use the analyze? method to enable or disable a certain analyzer
  # at query time.
  def analyze?
    !!query.context[:should_analyze]
  end

  def on_leave_field(node, _parent, visitor)
    # ...
  end

  def result
    # ...
  end
end
```

### Using Analyzers

The new query analyzers are added to the schema the same one as before with `query_analyzer`. However, to use the new analysis engine, you must opt in by using `use GraphQL::Analysis::AST`, for example:

```ruby
class MySchema < GraphQL::Schema
  use GraphQL::Analysis::AST
  query_analyzer MyQueryAnalyzer
end
```

**Make sure you pass the class and not an instance of your analyzer. The new analysis engine will take care of instantiating your analyzers with the query**.
